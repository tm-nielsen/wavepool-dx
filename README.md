# Wavepool-dx

A re-implementation of https://github.com/tm-nielsen/Wavepool in raylib. With any luck, I'll be able to make a proper web build, improve on the last version, and refresh myself on some C/C++.

VSCode build configuration relies on the portable installation of [w64devkit][0] and [emsdk][1], with `C:/w64devkit/bin` added to PATH as recommended *(emscripten will add itself during activation)*.
